The purpose of this toolbox is to generate dimensionality-reduced data from spike trains, facilitating visualization and further analysis. The toolbox integrates two algorithms to achieve this:
* spike train distance metric described by Victor and Purpura (1996)
* t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) (Van der Maaten and Hinton 2008).

For installation instructions, see `doc/INSTALL.md`.
For an example, open & run `SSIMS_demo_center_out.m` in MATLAB.
In addition, the C++ code implementing tSNE and useful spike train manipulation functions have some example code in src/test. `SSIMS_test.cpp` is essentially a port of `SSIMS_demo_center_out.m`, without plotting. On Mac/Linux, run with `make test`.


Version history
---------------

*   3.0.10: 3 November 2016
  Add build instructions for macOS 12 and MATLAB 2016b
*   3.0.9:  15 September 2016
  Major overhaul of the toolbox structure.
  Removed legacy functions, improved function signatures
  Add example with real data
  Improved installation instructions
  This is a pre-release to test functionality before wider distribution
*   3.0:    11 May 2016
	Rewrite of most of the toolbox. We now use armadillo for linear algebra functions.
	There are also efficient functions to extract spike trains in windows, based
	on custom C++ classes efficiently handling spike trains.
	Build instructions for Windows greatly improved
*   2.2:    17 Novemeber 2014
    First public release.
